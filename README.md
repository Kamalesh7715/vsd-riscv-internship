# 🚀 VSDSquadron Research Internship 2025 – Kamalesh

Welcome to my submission repository for the **VSDSquadron Research Internship 2025**, organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** under the mentorship of **Kunal Ghosh**.

This internship offered deep technical engagement with:

- 🧠 RISC-V architecture and toolchain setup  
- 🔧 Verilog simulation and waveform analysis using GTKWave and Icarus Verilog  
- 🛠️ Instruction decoding, compilation, and debugging with open-source tools  
- 🕹️ Cross-platform development challenges and linker troubleshooting  
- ⚙️ Foundations of SoC design through practical experiments
